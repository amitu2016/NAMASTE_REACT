1. NPM is used for dependency management and package management.
2. There are 2 types of dependencies which are installed : 1) Dev dependency 2) Normal dependency
3. In version number ^ means minor version will be upgraded automatically, ~ means major version
will be upgraded automatically.
4. package.json will keep track of approximate dependencies version while package-lock.json will
keep track of exact version.
5. Transitive dependency : We only installed parcel but many other packages gets installed 
in our project because parcel as a project need them as dependencies to function.
6. If you have package.json and package-lock.json in your project, you can re generate 
all your node modules. command : npm install
7. npm - we are just calling it to install the packages
npx - we are calling this command to execute the packages
8. CDN links are not the prefered way to bring the REACT library into our project.
9. To tell the browser that the script is not a normal browser script but a module, we write type="module" 
in script tag.
