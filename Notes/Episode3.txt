1. npx parcel index.html means we are executing node package parcel and give the source file as index.html
2. To create our own node scripts we have to add our scripts in scripts tag in package.json
3. npm start command is equivalent to npm run start command which calls npx parcel index.html in background.
4. React.createElement creates an object  which then renders into html element. We cant create html element 
directly from React.createElement.
5. ReactDom is used to create element which is for browser.
6. root.render will replace everything in index.html with its element.
7. JSX is not the only way to create React Elements
8. JSX is not HTML inside Javascript. It is only HTML or XML like syntax.
9. JSX is transpiled into Javascript code by parcel before it reaches Javascript engine.
10. parcel gives responsibility of transpiling to Babel.
