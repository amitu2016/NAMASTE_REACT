1. NPM is used for dependency management and package management.
2. There are 2 types of dependencies which are installed : 1) Dev dependency 2) Normal dependency
3. In version number ^ means minor version will be upgraded automatically, ~ means major version
will be upgraded automatically.
4. package.json will keep track of approximate dependencies version while package-lock.json will
keep track of exact version.
5. Transitive dependency : We only installed parcel but many other packages gets installed 
in our project because parcel as a project need them as dependencies to function.
